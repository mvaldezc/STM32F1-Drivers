# STM32F1-Drivers

This repository contains examples of custom peripheral drivers for an STM32F103C8 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller written in C++. Although this work will not be finished, it might serve as an example for coding some of the following drivers: 

* ADC
* USART
* TIMER
* PWM
* LCD 20X4
* GPIO
* DMA
* I2C

Note: Some of this libraries require further testing.
